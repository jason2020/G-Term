						<h2>What is G-Term</h2>
						<p class="myText">G-Term is an experience that gives students the opportunities to explore their interests within a wide range of courses through an experiential learning style. Students select G-Term courses they are interested in during the first semester and are assigned to one of those courses by the end of the semester. G-Term begins in the first week of January, before the second semester starts, to allow the students to transition back to an academic environment after a long winter break. Since G-Term classes do not assign any homework, students can learn without the stress of a grade.</p>

										<h3>Placement</h3>
									</header>
									<p class="myText">In the past, students had a stressful winter break since they had to take their final exams for their first semester classes as soon as they came back to school. G-Term aimed to remedy this problem by allowing students to take their final exams before the break, and instead they would have a relaxing yet educational experience when they came back to school. Summarizing this issue, Trisha Caley, the Academy Special Terms Director who organizes G-Term, said that “a few years ago, first semester exams were moved before Winter Break. Previously, we used to have finals when we returned in January. Moving final exams before break created two uneven semesters, and so a week in January was dedicated to G-Term.” As of now, G-Term is optimally placed to allow students to smoothly transition from a long winter break back to school. Because of this, there is a consensus among students and teachers that G-Term is current scheduled at an ideal time.

										<h3>Learning Experience</h3>
									</header>
									<p class="myText"> G-Term opens up many opportunities for students to explore their interests. According to Trisha Caley, the Academy Special Terms Director, “G-Term was designed to give both students and faculty opportunities to engage with the Aims of a Punahou Education. G-Term courses aim to give our community a chance to experience what learning opportunities would look like and feel like.” G-term offers a range of courses including island experiences like “Punahou Ninja Warrior” to international travel experiences like “Exploring and Comparing Seoul and Tokyo”. Students are also given the option to design and propose their own G-Term experience several months in advance. The variety of courses available each year ensures that almost every Punahou student can find a course that suits them. </p>

									<h3>Student and Teacher Interviews</h3>
									<p class="myText">In order to gain a better understanding about G-Term, we decided to interview teachers and students to gather different opinions and ideas about G-Term. Throughout our brief interviews, we asked participants about their opinions on various facets of G-Term including its current placement, the courses, and the course selection process. Moreover, we interviewed several teachers to learn about the process for developing and planning G-Term courses. </p>
									<p class="myText">We decided to primarily interview senior students since they have had the most experience participating in a variety of G-Term courses and have experienced the changes from year-to-year. In regards to courses and the selection process, students had mixed views. Some students had amazing experiences in engaging courses, while others were given G-term courses that they felt were boring and meaningless. Although not everyone has had a positive experience with G-Term, one aspect of G-Term that was unanimously supported was its current placement. Every single student who responded to our interviews said that having G-Term right before the second semester was ideal. </p>

						<h2>Survey Data</h2>

					<h2 id="thing">The Future of G-Term</h2>
					<p>Ms. Caley, the Academy Special Terms Director, says, “I wonder if we will be able to lengthen the program, and then eventually find a way to credit students (other than C/NC) for their G-Term participation.  Also, I wonder if we can find ways to subsidize the travel program, so that travel is accessible to lots of students.” Based on our interviews and research, we believe G-Term will continue to improve and expand in numerous ways as courses are tried and tested. In the future, the G-Term courses that are currently popular, such as “Ultimate Frisbee”, “Local Grindz”, and “Medical Immersion”, will likely remain. Currently, Ms. Caley manually assigns students to their G-Term courses, but a more efficient algorithm may be developed in the future that could optimize the way students are matched to each course, so that they receive their preferred choices. We predict that the future of G-Term will be bright, as the courses will be expanded and improved, and the selection process will hopefully be automated. </p>
